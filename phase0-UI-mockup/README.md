Notes about the Packet Flight Simulator


We all know that DDoS are increasingly becoming a problem for us all. We need protection from DDoS, but how good are out networks when the packets come-a-knockin?

We would like to simulate DDoS this is the aim, but unfortunately we see that a lot of infrastructures require changes to be able to handle even small scale attacks. We thus decided to perform active testing of infrastructures using packet generators.

Packet Flight Simulator is a tool to help you while testing network infrastructure like firewalls, routers and 
the whole network really.

What Packet Flight Simulator aims to do:
* Get an overview of the tasks you need to perform to complete a good test
* See primary metrics while performing the test, AND log these events
* Be able to re-visit the log and explain exactly which tools were running at a specific time

Sounds easy, right.

How to perform a good test


Running a simple packet generator from a high-speed device will often show that settings on devices are less than optimal, and could be changed, and re-test done. Using this methodology we have improved our customers stance against DDoS considerably.


Problems when doing testing

There are some problems, apart from running security testing, getting approval etc.

One of the main problems we face are that we must log information about the testing performed, and which attacks had a bad influence on the availability of the network and services.
